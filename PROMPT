i am making a website to convert musical notes to button cajun accordion "notes". 
so the idea is that i can take my midi keyboard, play a tune, input that into this program, and i'll convert it to the buttons i need to press + push vs. pull on my accordion. 

let's make a python program to do the backend for this. a script for now but should be converted to a fastapi app later. 

important mapping - we should represent this. 
for a C accordion:

Button   |    Push Note.     |.  Pull note
------------------------------------
1 | E | G
2 | G | B
3 | C | D
4 | E | F
5 | G | A
6 | C | B
7 | E | D
8 | G | F
9 | C | A
10 | E | B

we can assume for now that we're using a C tuned accordion. but that should be configurable. 

let's ignore octaves for now. 


for example, take the song Beau Jocque Boogie. i have these notes:

C D F  --- G A G F


What buttons would i press?

better way to do this output .... 
we offer two ways. one is verbose (which is what you did above - "Button 3 - Push")
the other is simple

3     <== this is "button 3 - Push"
[4']  <=== this is "button 4 - Pull"

please add this

=== output


Sample Output
For notes = ["C", "D", "F", "G", "A", "G", "F"], youâ€™ll see:
